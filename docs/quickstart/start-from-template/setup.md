To create composable apps/ [blocks](/docs/core-concepts/core#block), we definitely need some set of tools.

BB(Build with Blocks) CLI is used to create, collaborate, manage, and deploy blocks by connecting with Appblocks Registry.

**Pre requisites**

* you will need pre installed node run time 
  - required: { npm: '>=8.1.0', node: '16.13.0 - 16.20.1 || 18.12.0 - 18.17.0' }
  If you are using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) run the following command
  ```
  nvm install 18.17.0
  ```
* Currently we only support linux and mac operating systems

**Install BB CLI**
```
  npm i @appblocks/bb-cli -g
```
This will install our CLI globally.

```NOTE - Currently we only support in Linux/ Unix machines, including Mac.```
