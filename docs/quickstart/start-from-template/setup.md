To create composable apps/[blocks](/docs/core-concepts/core#block), we definitely need some set of tools.

BB (Build with Blocks) CLI is used to create, collaborate, manage, and deploy blocks by connecting with the Appblocks Registry (Block Store).

**Prerequisites**

* You will require pre-installed node run-time version > 15
* Currently, we support only Linux and Mac operating systems

**Install BB CLI**
```
  npm i @appblocks/bb-cli -g
```
This will install BB CLI globally.

```NOTE - Currently, we support only in Linux/Unix machines, including Mac.```

Hit "bb" to view all the commands in CLI.
