# Types of Blocks

We have predefined types for blocks in the registry. Each type refers to where and how it is utilised. Following is the list of Block Types available.

## UI Block

`UI Block is a frontend Block` as its name suggests, and is developed for browser runtimes. 

As of now, we only support React-based UI Block. 

Each Block can be a part of a business use case. For example, a login page with APIs integrated can be a Blox, which when connected with a matching Fn Block will be enough to implement login functionality in any application.

`All UI Block which has at least one Fn Blox integration should adhere to an API schema.`

UI Blocks are of two types,

###  UI Element Block

These are independently developed and tested `unit frontend Block`.

This Block is not supposed to work alone but be pulled into a UI container Block/ host Block and run together. This process of connecting the elements happens at runtime. 

Appblock enforces strict standard regulations as there are increased chances of runtime errors. It ensures that all the element Blocks which are supposed to be connected are composable by design.

### Container Block

These are the `orchestrators in the Frontend`. 

This type of Block will have the main routing files and placeholders for the remote modules. It will decide when to pull and how to render a remote element Block.

The Container Block decides the layout of the entire app and it renders when you visit the app URL. 

It will pull the required bundles from the remote servers, stitch them together at runtime and render the app.

## Fn Block

`Fn Blocks are the backend Blocks`. 

We design Fn Blocks in a `FaaS Architecture`. 

Each Fn Block is supposed to be `mutually exclusive`. 

Every Fn Block will have a specific URL to invoke it and in practical scenarios, all the Fn Blocks in an app will be stitched together and run in a single instance on the server.

In case a particular Fn is having more traffic, ie, needs to be scaled that Fn Blocks alone will be isolated and run in a separate instance. 

Appblock gateway in the proxy layer will intelligently route the traffic between the stitched app and the isolated Fn Block instance.

Fn Blocks are language agnostic. Despite that, is always better for developers to stick with the same language in app development for maintainability.

All functions which have a database call should adhere to a database schema.

As of now, we only support Nodejs.

## Shared Block

In both frontend and backend, there is `some piece of code that is not adhering to Block Spec`. These are just `reusable pieces of code` such as a function to find the age of a person from dob.

With our efficient searching dashboard, it would be easy for a developer to find shared Blocks for any random use case.

In the frontend, it can be either a very common function, for example, a function to find the difference between two dates or a reusable button with a default loader added. 

## App Block

`UI, Fn and shared Blocks have their own repositories`. They are the building blocks of an application. 

Once all the Blocks are stitched together, we build a configuration that is a snapshot of how the apps are composed. 

This configuration can be pulled and run on any machine using Yah CLI. We call this hypothetical entity an `Appblock`. 

It's a collection of Blocks that will act together as an application.

## Block.config.json 

This is a `configuration file found in the root folder of all the Block`. 

It will hold the `meta information of the Block`, which can be read by the CLI / registry to identify the `Type of Block, its repository, version etc…`

## Appblock.config.json

This `configuration file is at the root of any Appblock`. 

Appblock.config.json will have `meta-information about all the Blocks in that Appblock` and other `necessary metadata about its runtime`. 

This configuration resides in the Blocks registry and can be pulled by anyone who has the right access privileges.

Yah CLI has APIs which can read this config, pull the dependencies and run them on the local machine. 

`We use this configuration file to get the necessary information while deploying.` So without this configuration, app deployment won't work.
