# Blocks Architecture

“As business needs change, organizations must be able to deliver innovation quickly and adapt applications dynamically — reassembling capabilities from inside and outside the enterprise. To do this, organizations must understand and implement the “composable enterprise.” – Gartner

Composable enterprise is an approach to design that embraces the API economy, delivering business outcomes through the assembly and combination of packaged business capabilities.

We often have the need to reuse common business use cases in the same or multiple Apps. 

So we derived Block and Block Architecture, a Composable Application Framework.

> ### “A unit of an app which solves a business use case with its code and contracts” - Block


Apps developed through Yahilo are adhered to `Block Spec` comprised of `SDM, a collection of Standard Data Models and API layer schemas.`

## Philosophies

- Reusability
- Independent Blocks development
- Each block will be inside separate Repos ( MultiRepo) 
- Independent version management of block
- Independent and Instant Deployment of block
- Independently testable modules - Auditability
- Micro Frontend for Frontend Development
- FaaS for Backend Development
- Blocks can be language agnostic
- Pre Defined set of Standard Data Models.

We have two type of mode of operations, SaaS and Business - link

In Business Model, we create Database for an organisation and all apps installed by that organisation will be connected to it. Since they share a common Block Spec, Same DB and API schemas, and share a Common DB, the apps will be connected by design.
