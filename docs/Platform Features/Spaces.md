# Spaces

Space is where you as an organization collaborate, manage access, subscriptions, licenses and track your blocks and its details. Manage everything related to Appblocks with spaces. Helps your organizations and teams to collaboratively work on applications and blocks and allows you to manage accesses of all these, all in one workspace. 

When you create an Appblocks account, a space is created by default. All your activities will reflect here unless you create new spaces or are invited to others.

* ACL (access control list) are policies that can be handpicked and granted to the members of a space by the admins of the same. 
* Members ACL shows a comprehensive view of all the accesses a member has received across the space. 
* For access controls more specific to a block or an app with respect to a member, the corresponding ACLs can be used.
