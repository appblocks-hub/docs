#### Installing the Block
1. [Install the BB-CLI](https://docs.appblocks.com/docs/quickstart/start-from-template/setup)
2. [Connect the CLI with GitHub.](https://docs.appblocks.com/docs/quickstart/start-from-template/connect%20github)
3. If you chose a package block, skip this step. If you chose a Function/UI/Shared block, create a package block and use the chosen block in it. Create a package block with the command "bb [init](https://docs.appblocks.com/docs/CLI/commands) package-name" and change directory to the package block context with "cd package-name".
4. Copy and paste the command in BB-CLI.
