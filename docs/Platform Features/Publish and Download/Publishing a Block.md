# Publishing a Block

The blocks you create with the BB-CLI will appear in the store and other pages of your logged in Appblocks account right after the sync step. 
Ensure that you have [created a version and published the block from the CLI](https://docs.appblocks.com/docs/CLI/commands). 

* Visit the [Manage Blocks](https://docs.appblocks.com/docs/Platform%20Features/Sales%20and%20Purchases/Manage%20Blocks) page.
* Choose your own blocks tab from the table and find your block.
* There will be a call to action to publish the block.

* On clicking the Publish, you will be redirected to fill out a form.

* Submit the form and wait for Appblocks admins to review your block. The review status will be shown on the last tab. If approved, your block will get published in the Block Store.
